If you've read the whole wiki and still got questions, you've come to the right place. Below you can see a list of questions that I have been commonly asked and their respective answers.

### Q: What is FXGL again?
A: FXGL (FX Game Library) is a 2D game development framework based on JavaFX.

### Q: What can I do with FXGL?
A: You can build a variety of 2D and UI based games. You should be able to rewrite most of existing 2D games, but it also depends on the complexity of the game itself. In addition, as FXGL is a superset of JavaFX, you can do everything you could previously do in JavaFX, but hopefully easier and/or faster.

### Q: I'm doing a school / academic project. Can I use FXGL?
A: If you are a student, you should address this question to your teacher to find out if 3rd party libraries are allowed in your project. If you _are_ the teacher, then feel free to contact me if you need help adapting your module / course to use FXGL.

### Q: If I use FXGL for something, do I need to worry about license / credits?
A: No. It's under MIT, so feel free to do anything you want with it. Something like "Powered by FXGL" would be nice, but it's up to you.

### Q: Do I need to have any special development environment?
A: No. You do not need any environment variables or native libraries. You can also use any IDE of choice. This makes FXGL perfect for the academic environment.

### Q: Which language can I use with FXGL?
A: When it is distributed (Maven / Gradle / uber jar), it can be used like any other Java library, so you should be able to use it with any JVM language.

### Q: There are libraries like LibGDX, JMonkey, why use FXGL?
A: If you are serious about game development I would suggest that you use LibGDX or JMonkey as they will provide you with better support both in terms of tools and performance. FXGL was not meant to compete with any other existing game library. It started off as a collection of code snippets to help me run JavaFX tutorials on YouTube, so that I don't type the same code across tutorials. As the codebase grew I decided to make a library out of it and share with everyone who is interested in learning JavaFX and/or game development.

### Q: How many people use the framework?
A: The framework does not have any tracking code built in, so the only way I can know that it's being used if someone contacts me. So far I've been contacted by a number of academic institutions across the world, who let me know that they are using FXGL. You can see notable FXGL users [here](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL#community).

### Q: Does FXGL support mobile?
A: Yes. Both Android and iOS via JavaFXPorts / javafx client plugin.

### Q: Does FXGL support web?
A: Yes, via JPro.

### Q: What's FXGL written in?
A: The high-level classes & interfaces are written in Java, while the low-level implementations are in Kotlin.

### Q: I'm building my own game engine and I found some useful code in FXGL. Can I copy it?
A: Help yourself, but reference to the original source is appreciated.

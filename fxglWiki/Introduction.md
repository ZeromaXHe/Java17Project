## FXGL

FXGL (FX Game Library) is a 2D game development framework based on JavaFX.

## Use Case

The goal of FXGL is to bring game development tools and techniques to JavaFX without extra setup work.
Just add FXGL to your project as a library and you're good to go. You can use any combination of IDE and OS.
Thus, FXGL is perfectly suited for the academic environment and hobby projects.
It is also robust enough to support commercial projects.
It is MIT licensed, so you are free to do anything you want with the code and the framework.

## Philosophy

FXGL endeavors to be simple and easy to use, while providing access to a range of real-world game development techniques.
Note that the framework is not meant to compete with libGDX or any other library (though in some cases FXGL can be superior), rather it's a stepping stone for those who wish to learn game development.
FXGL draws inspiration from the following game engines:

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)
* [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx)
* [jMonkey](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine)
* [CRYENGINE](https://github.com/CRYTEK-CRYENGINE/CRYENGINE)
* [X-Ray](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16)
* [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK)
* [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality)
* [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)

The following books / resources also play an influential role in the FXGL development:

* [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) by Bob Nystrom
* [Game Development Tuts+](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/)
* Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
